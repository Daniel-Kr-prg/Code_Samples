Create a simple calculator. The program gradually asks the user about the operation so that 1 corresponds to the sum, 2 to the difference, 3 to the product and 4 to the quotient. After selecting an operation, the program asks for two operands, which are correctly labeled according to the selected operation - i.e. for the sum, it asks for the addendum, for the difference, for the minor and the numerator, for the product, for the factor, and for the share, for the numerator and divisor. The last input to the program is the number of decimal places that will be used to print the result.
