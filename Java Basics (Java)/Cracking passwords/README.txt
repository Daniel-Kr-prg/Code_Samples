You made an unexpectedly valuable catch - you got your hands on the assignment of tests from PJV. Unfortunately, these tests are locked in a safe with an electronic lock. You can connect your computer to this lock, with which you can try different passwords. One of the methods of cracking passwords is an intuitive so-called brute force attack. In this method, the attacker successively tries all possible combinations of characters until he guesses the password.
